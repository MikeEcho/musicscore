**musicscore2** is a library in python to generate musicxml4 data in a comprehensive way. The generated files can be imported in serveral music notation softwares and be processed further if necessary. The prefered software is Finale which seems to have at the moment the best implementation of musicxml format files.

This library consists of three parts: The first part (XML) is made of xml classes which are closely designed in relation to musicxml4 schemes and can be used to generate xml partials as strings. Theses snipets are put together using the second part of the library (TreeMusic) which deals with the tree hirearchy of musicxml format files. Although most of music notation softwares prefere to import a partwise musicxml (except Finale which can import timewise as well as partwise scores) the internal logic of TreeMusic aims at creating a timewise score. This choice was made based on the fact that the timewise structure is believed to be the more intuitive one in sense of compositional thinking. There is nevertheless the possiblity to convert a timewise score to a partwise one at the end of the generating process.
