**musicscore2** is a library in python to generate musicxml data in a comprehensive way. The generated files can be imported in serveral music notation softwares and be processed further if necessary. The prefered software is Finale which seems to have at the moment the best implementation of musicxml format files and supports the newest version i.e. 4.0.

This library consists of three parts: The first part (musicxml) is made of xml classes which are closely designed in relation to musicxml schemes (3.1 or 4.0) and can be used to generate xml partials as strings. Theses snipets are put together using the second part of the library (musictree) which deals with the tree hirearchy of musicxml format files. Since almost all music notation softwares only support musicxml in its partwise formation, musicscore2 generates only partwise scores (other than its preciding library musicscore). Timewise musicxml files are at the moment supported only by Finale.
