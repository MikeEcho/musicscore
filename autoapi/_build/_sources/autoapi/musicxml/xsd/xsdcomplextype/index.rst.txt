   Bases: :py:obj:`XSDComplexType`

   Notes are the most common type of MusicXML data. The MusicXML format distinguishes between elements used for sound information and elements used for notation information (e.g., tie is used for sound, tied for notation). Thus grace notes do not have a duration element. Cue notes have a duration element, as do forward elements, but no tie elements. Having these two types of information available can make interchange easier, as some programs handle one type of information more readily than the other.

   The print-leger attribute is used to indicate whether leger lines are printed. Notes without leger lines are used to indicate indeterminate high and low notes. By default, it is set to yes. If print-object is set to no, print-leger is interpreted to also be set to no if not present. This attribute is ignored for rests.

   The dynamics and end-dynamics attributes correspond to MIDI 1.0's Note On and Note Off velocities, respectively. They are expressed in terms of percentages of the default forte value (90 for MIDI 1.0).

   The attack and release attributes are used to alter the starting and stopping time of the note from when it would otherwise occur based on the flow of durations - information that is specific to a performance. They are expressed in terms of divisions, either positive or negative. A note that starts a tie should not have a release attribute, and a note that stops a tie should not have an attack attribute. The attack and release attributes are independent of each other. The attack attribute only changes the starting time of a note, and the release attribute only changes the stopping time of a note.

   If a note is played only particular times through a repeat, the time-only attribute shows which times to play the note.

   The pizzicato attribute is used when just this note is sounded pizzicato, vs. the pizzicato element which changes overall playback between pizzicato and arco.

.. py:class:: XSDComplexTypeAccidentalText(value=None, parent=None, *args, **kwargs)

.. py:class:: XSDComplexTypeCoda(value=None, parent=None, *args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`XSDComplexType`

   The coda type is the visual indicator of a coda sign. The exact glyph can be specified with the smufl attribute. A sound element is also needed to guide playback applications reliably.

   .. py:attribute:: _SIMPLE_CONTENT
      

      

   .. py:attribute:: XSD_TREE
      

      


.. py:class:: XSDComplexTypeDynamics(value=None, parent=None, *args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`XSDComplexType`

   Dynamics can be associated either with a note or a general musical direction. To avoid inconsistencies between and amongst the letter abbreviations for dynamics (what is sf vs. sfz, standing alone or with a trailing dynamic that is not always piano), we use the actual letters as the names of these dynamic elements. The other-dynamics element allows other dynamic marks that are not covered here. Dynamics elements may also be combined to create marks not covered by a single element, such as sfmp.

   These letter dynamic symbols are separated from crescendo, decrescendo, and wedge indications. Dynamic representation is inconsistent in scores. Many things are assumed by the composer and left out, such as returns to original dynamics. The MusicXML format captures what is in the score, but does not try to be optimal for analysis or synthesis of dynamics.

   The placement attribute is used when the dynamics are associated with a note. It is ignored when the dynamics are associated with a direction. In that case the direction element's placement attribute is used instead.

   The level type is used to specify editorial information for different MusicXML elements. The content contains identifying and/or descriptive text about the editorial status of the parent element.

   If the reference attribute is yes, this indicates editorial information that is for display only and should not affect playback. For instance, a modern edition of older music may set reference="yes" on the attributes containing the music's original clef, key, and time signature. It is no if not specified.

   The type attribute indicates whether the editorial information applies to the start of a series of symbols, the end of a series of symbols, or a single symbol. It is single if not specified for compatibility with earlier MusicXML versions.

   Bases: :py:obj:`XSDComplexType`

   The beat-repeat type is used to indicate that a single beat (but possibly many notes) is repeated. The slashes attribute specifies the number of slashes to use in the symbol. The use-dots attribute indicates whether or not to use dots as well (for instance, with mixed rhythm patterns). The value for slashes is 1 and the value for use-dots is no if not specified.

   The stop type indicates the first beat where the repeats are no longer displayed. Both the start and stop of the beat being repeated should be specified unless the repeats are displayed through the end of the part.

   The beat-repeat element specifies a notation style for repetitions. The actual music being repeated needs to be repeated within the MusicXML file. This element specifies the notation that indicates the repeat.

   A cancel element indicates that the old key signature should be cancelled before the new one appears. This will always happen when changing to C major or A minor and need not be specified then. The cancel value matches the fifths value of the cancelled key signature (e.g., a cancel of -2 will provide an explicit cancellation for changing from B flat major to F major). The optional location attribute indicates where the cancellation appears relative to the new key signature.

   Bases: :py:obj:`XSDComplexType`

   Clefs are represented by a combination of sign, line, and clef-octave-change elements. The optional number attribute refers to staff numbers within the part. A value of 1 is assumed if not present.

   Sometimes clefs are added to the staff in non-standard line positions, either to indicate cue passages, or when there are multiple clefs present simultaneously on one staff. In this situation, the additional attribute is set to "yes" and the line value is ignored. The size attribute is used for clefs where the additional attribute is "yes". It is typically used to indicate cue clefs.

   Sometimes clefs at the start of a measure need to appear after the barline rather than before, as for cues or for use after a repeated section. The after-barline attribute is set to "yes" in this situation. The attribute is ignored for mid-measure clefs.

   Clefs appear at the start of each system unless the print-object attribute has been set to "no" or the additional attribute has been set to "yes".

The print-object attribute allows lines to be hidden within a staff. This is used in special situations such as a widely-spaced percussion staff where a note placed below the higher line is distinct from a note placed above the lower line. Hidden staff lines are included when specifying clef lines and determining display-step / display-octave values, but are not counted as lines for the purposes of the system-layout and staff-layout elements.

   The part-symbol type indicates how a symbol for a multi-staff part is indicated in the score; brace is the default value. The top-staff and bottom-staff attributes are used when the brace does not extend across the entire part. For example, in a 3-staff organ part, the top-staff will typically be 1 for the right hand, while the bottom-staff will typically be 2 for the left hand. Staff 3 for the pedals is usually outside the brace. By default, the presence of a part-symbol element that does not extend across the entire part also indicates a corresponding change in the common barlines within a part.

   The staff-details element is used to indicate different types of staves. The optional number attribute specifies the staff number from top to bottom on the system, as with clef. The print-object attribute is used to indicate when a staff is not printed in a part, usually in large scores where empty parts are omitted. It is yes by default. If print-spacing is yes while print-object is no, the score is printed in cutaway format where vertical space is left for the empty part.

.. py:class:: XSDComplexTypeStaffSize(value=None, parent=None, *args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`XSDComplexType`

   The staff-size element indicates how large a staff space is on this staff, expressed as a percentage of the work's default scaling. Values less than 100 make the staff space smaller while values over 100 make the staff space larger. A staff-type of cue, ossia, or editorial implies a staff-size of less than 100, but the exact value is implementation-dependent unless specified here. Staff size affects staff height only, not the relationship of the staff to the left and right margins.

   In some cases, a staff-size different than 100 also scales the notation on the staff, such as with a cue staff. In other cases, such as percussion staves, the lines may be more widely spaced without scaling the notation on the staff. The scaling attribute allows these two cases to be distinguished. It specifies the percentage scaling that applies to the notation. Values less that 100 make the notation smaller while values over 100 make the notation larger. The staff-size content and scaling attribute are both non-negative decimal values.

   Time signatures are represented by the beats element for the numerator and the beat-type element for the denominator. The symbol attribute is used to indicate common and cut time symbols as well as a single number display. Multiple pairs of beat and beat-type elements are used for composite time signatures with multiple denominators, such as 2/4 + 3/8. A composite such as 3+2/8 requires only one beat/beat-type pair.

   The print-object attribute allows a time signature to be specified but not printed, as is the case for excerpts from the middle of a score. The value is "yes" if not present. The optional number attribute refers to staff numbers within the part. If absent, the time signature applies to all staves in the part.

.. py:class:: XSDComplexTypeBarline(value=None, parent=None, *args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`XSDComplexType`

   If a barline is other than a normal single barline, it should be represented by a barline type that describes it. This includes information about repeats and multiple endings, as well as line style. Barline data is on the same level as the other musical data in a score - a child of a measure in a partwise score, or a part in a timewise score. This allows for barlines within measures, as in dotted barlines that subdivide measures in complex meters. The two fermata elements allow for fermatas on both sides of the barline (the lower one inverted).

   Barlines have a location attribute to make it easier to process barlines independently of the other musical data in a score. It is often easier to set up measures separately from entering notes. The location attribute must match where the barline element occurs within the rest of the musical data in the score. If location is left, it should be the first element in the measure, aside from the print, bookmark, and link elements. If location is right, it should be the last element, again with the possible exception of the print, bookmark, and link elements. If no location is specified, the right barline is the default. The segno, coda, and divisions attributes work the same way as in the sound element. They are used for playback when barline elements contain segno or coda child elements.

.. py:class:: XSDComplexTypeEnding(value=None, parent=None, *args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`XSDComplexType`

   The ending type represents multiple (e.g. first and second) endings. Typically, the start type is associated with the left barline of the first measure in an ending. The stop and discontinue types are associated with the right barline of the last measure in an ending. Stop is used when the ending mark concludes with a downward jog, as is typical for first endings. Discontinue is used when there is no downward jog, as is typical for second endings that do not conclude a piece. The length of the jog can be specified using the end-length attribute. The text-x and text-y attributes are offsets that specify where the baseline of the start of the ending text appears, relative to the start of the ending line.

   The number attribute indicates which times the ending is played, similar to the time-only attribute used by other elements. While this often represents the numeric values for what is under the ending line, it can also indicate whether an ending is played during a larger dal segno or da capo repeat. Single endings such as "1" or comma-separated multiple endings such as "1,2" may be used. The ending element text is used when the text displayed in the ending is different than what appears in the number attribute. The print-object attribute is used to indicate when an ending is present but not printed, as is often the case for many parts in a full score.

   A direction is a musical indication that is not necessarily attached to a specific note. Two or more may be combined to indicate words followed by the start of a dashed line, the end of a wedge followed by dynamics, etc. For applications where a specific direction is indeed attached to a specific note, the direction element can be associated with the first note element that follows it in score order that is not in a different voice.

   By default, a series of direction-type elements and a series of child elements of a direction-type within a single direction element follow one another in sequence visually. For a series of direction-type children, non-positional formatting attributes are carried over from the previous element by default.

   Bases: :py:obj:`XSDComplexType`

   The harmony type represents harmony analysis, including chord symbols in popular music as well as functional harmony analysis in classical music.

   If there are alternate harmonies possible, this can be specified using multiple harmony elements differentiated by type. Explicit harmonies have all note present in the music; implied have some notes missing but implied; alternate represents alternate analyses.

   The print-object attribute controls whether or not anything is printed due to the harmony element. The print-frame attribute controls printing of a frame or fretboard diagram. The print-style attribute group sets the default for the harmony, but individual elements can override this with their own print-style values. The arrangement attribute specifies how multiple harmony-chord groups are arranged relative to each other. Harmony-chords with vertical arrangement are separated by horizontal lines. Harmony-chords with diagonal or horizontal arrangement are separated by diagonal lines or slashes.

   Bases: :py:obj:`XSDComplexType`

   Kind indicates the type of chord. Degree elements can then add, subtract, or alter from these starting points

   The attributes are used to indicate the formatting of the symbol. Since the kind element is the constant in all the harmony-chord groups that can make up a polychord, many formatting attributes are here.

   The use-symbols attribute is yes if the kind should be represented when possible with harmony symbols rather than letters and numbers. These symbols include:

           major: a triangle, like Unicode 25B3
           minor: -, like Unicode 002D
           augmented: +, like Unicode 002B
           diminished: °, like Unicode 00B0
           half-diminished: ø, like Unicode 00F8

   For the major-minor kind, only the minor symbol is used when use-symbols is yes. The major symbol is set using the symbol attribute in the degree-value element. The corresponding degree-alter value will usually be 0 in this case.

   The text attribute describes how the kind should be spelled in a score. If use-symbols is yes, the value of the text attribute follows the symbol. The stack-degrees attribute is yes if the degree elements should be stacked above each other. The parentheses-degrees attribute is yes if all the degrees should be in parentheses. The bracket-degrees attribute is yes if all the degrees should be in a bracket. If not specified, these values are implementation-specific. The alignment attributes are for the entire harmony-chord group of which this kind element is a part.

   The text attribute may use strings such as "13sus" that refer to both the kind and one or more degree elements. In this case, the corresponding degree elements should have the print-object attribute set to "no" to keep redundant alterations from being displayed.

   Bases: :py:obj:`XSDComplexType`

   The listen and listening types, new in Version 4.0, specify different ways that a score following or machine listening application can interact with a performer. The listening type handles interactions that change the state of the listening application from the specified point in the performance onward. If multiple child elements of the same type are present, they should have distinct player and/or time-only attributes.

   The offset element is used to indicate that the listening change takes place offset from the current score position. If the listening element is a child of a direction element, the listening offset element overrides the direction offset element if both elements are present. Note that the offset reflects the intended musical position for the change in state. It should not be used to compensate for latency issues in particular hardware configurations.

   The measure-numbering type describes how frequently measure numbers are displayed on this part. The text attribute from the measure element is used for display, or the number attribute if the text attribute is not present. Measures with an implicit attribute set to "yes" never display a measure number, regardless of the measure-numbering setting.

   The optional staff attribute refers to staff numbers within the part, from top to bottom on the system. It indicates which staff is used as the reference point for vertical positioning. A value of 1 is assumed if not present.

   The optional multiple-rest-always and multiple-rest-range attributes describe how measure numbers are shown on multiple rests when the measure-numbering value is not set to none. The multiple-rest-always attribute is set to yes when the measure number should always be shown, even if the multiple rest starts midway through a system when measure numbering is set to system level. The multiple-rest-range attribute is set to yes when measure numbers on multiple rests display the range of numbers for the first and last measure, rather than just the number of the first measure.

The metronome-note and metronome-relation elements allow for the specification of metric modulations and other metric relationships, such as swing tempo marks where two eighths are equated to a quarter note / eighth note triplet. Tied notes can be represented in both types of metronome marks by using the beat-unit-tied and metronome-tied elements. The parentheses attribute indicates whether or not to put the metronome mark in parentheses; its value is no if not specified. The print-object attribute is set to no in cases where the metronome element represents a relationship or range that is not displayed in the music notation.

   An offset is represented in terms of divisions, and indicates where the direction will appear relative to the current musical location. The current musical location is always within the current measure, even at the end of a measure.

   The offset affects the visual appearance of the direction. If the sound attribute is "yes", then the offset affects playback and listening too. If the sound attribute is "no", then any sound or listening associated with the direction takes effect at the current location. The sound attribute is "no" by default for compatibility with earlier versions of the MusicXML format. If an element within a direction includes a default-x attribute, the offset value will be ignored when determining the appearance of that element.

.. py:class:: XSDComplexTypeSound(value=None, parent=None, *args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`XSDComplexType`

   The sound element contains general playback parameters. They can stand alone within a part/measure, or be a component element within a direction.

   Tempo is expressed in quarter notes per minute. If 0, the sound-generating program should prompt the user at the time of compiling a sound (MIDI) file.

   Dynamics (or MIDI velocity) are expressed as a percentage of the default forte value (90 for MIDI 1.0).

   Dacapo indicates to go back to the beginning of the movement. When used it always has the value "yes".

   Segno and dalsegno are used for backwards jumps to a segno sign; coda and tocoda are used for forward jumps to a coda sign. If there are multiple jumps, the value of these parameters can be used to name and distinguish them. If segno or coda is used, the divisions attribute can also be used to indicate the number of divisions per quarter note. Otherwise sound and MIDI generating programs may have to recompute this.

   By default, a dalsegno or dacapo attribute indicates that the jump should occur the first time through, while a tocoda attribute indicates the jump should occur the second time through. The time that jumps occur can be changed by using the time-only attribute.

   The forward-repeat attribute indicates that a forward repeat sign is implied but not displayed. It is used for example in two-part forms with repeats, such as a minuet and trio where no repeat is displayed at the start of the trio. This usually occurs after a barline. When used it always has the value of "yes".

   The fine attribute follows the final note or rest in a movement with a da capo or dal segno direction. If numeric, the value represents the actual duration of the final note or rest, which can be ambiguous in written notation and different among parts and voices. The value may also be "yes" to indicate no change to the final duration.

   If the sound element applies only particular times through a repeat, the time-only attribute indicates which times to apply the sound element.

   Pizzicato in a sound element effects all following notes. Yes indicates pizzicato, no indicates arco.

   The pan and elevation attributes are deprecated in Version 2.0. The pan and elevation elements in the midi-instrument element should be used instead. The meaning of the pan and elevation attributes is the same as for the pan and elevation elements. If both are present, the mid-instrument elements take priority.

   The damper-pedal, soft-pedal, and sostenuto-pedal attributes effect playback of the three common piano pedals and their MIDI controller equivalents. The yes value indicates the pedal is depressed; no indicates the pedal is released. A numeric value from 0 to 100 may also be used for half pedaling. This value is the percentage that the pedal is depressed. A value of 0 is equivalent to no, and a value of 100 is equivalent to yes.

   Instrument changes, MIDI devices, MIDI instruments, and playback techniques are changed using the instrument-change, midi-device, midi-instrument, and play elements. When there are multiple instances of these elements, they should be grouped together by instrument using the id attribute values.

   The offset element is used to indicate that the sound takes place offset from the current score position. If the sound element is a child of a direction element, the sound offset element overrides the direction offset element if both elements are present. Note that the offset reflects the intended musical position for the change in sound. It should not be used to compensate for latency issues in particular hardware configurations.

.. py:class:: XSDComplexTypeSwing(value=None, parent=None, *args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`XSDComplexType`

   The swing element specifies whether or not to use swing playback, where consecutive on-beat / off-beat eighth or 16th notes are played with unequal nominal durations. 

   The straight element specifies that no swing is present, so consecutive notes have equal durations.

   The first and second elements are positive integers that specify the ratio between durations of consecutive notes. For example, a first element with a value of 2 and a second element with a value of 1 applied to eighth notes specifies a quarter note / eighth note tuplet playback, where the first note is twice as long as the second note. Ratios should be specified with the smallest integers possible. For example, a ratio of 6 to 4 should be specified as 3 to 2 instead.

   The optional swing-type element specifies the note type, either eighth or 16th, to which the ratio is applied. The value is eighth if this element is not present.

   The optional swing-style element is a string describing the style of swing used.

   The swing element has no effect for playback of grace notes, notes where a type element is not present, and notes where the specified duration is different than the nominal value associated with the specified type. If a swung note has attack and release attributes, those values modify the swung playback.

   The system-dividers element indicates the presence or absence of system dividers (also known as system separation marks) between systems displayed on the same page. Dividers on the left and right side of the page are controlled by the left-divider and right-divider elements respectively. The default vertical position is half the system-distance value from the top of the system that is below the divider. The default horizontal position is the left and right system margin, respectively.

   When used in the print element, the system-dividers element affects the dividers that would appear between the current system and the previous system.

   Bases: :py:obj:`XSDComplexType`

   A system is a group of staves that are read and played simultaneously. System layout includes left and right margins and the vertical distance from the previous system. The system distance is measured from the bottom line of the previous system to the top line of the current system. It is ignored for the first system on a page. The top system distance is measured from the page's top margin to the top line of the first system. It is ignored for all but the first system on a page.

   Sometimes the sum of measure widths in a system may not equal the system width specified by the layout elements due to roundoff or other errors. The behavior when reading MusicXML files in these cases is application-dependent. For instance, applications may find that the system layout data is more reliable than the sum of the measure widths, and adjust the measure widths accordingly.

   When used in the defaults element, the system-layout element defines a default appearance for all systems in the score. If no system-layout element is present in the defaults element, default system layout values are chosen by the application.

   When used in the print element, the system-layout element affects the appearance of the current system only. All other systems use the default values as determined by the defaults element. If any child elements are missing from the system-layout element in a print element, the values determined by the defaults element are used there as well. This type of system-layout element need only be read from or written to the first visible part in the score.

The number attribute can be used to distinguish between two simultaneous chords arpeggiated separately (different numbers) or together (same number). The direction attribute is used if there is an arrow on the arpeggio sign. By default, arpeggios go from the lowest to highest note.  The length of the sign can be determined from the position attributes for the arpeggiate elements used with the top and bottom notes of the arpeggiated chord. If the unbroken attribute is set to yes, it indicates that the arpeggio continues onto another staff within the part. This serves as a hint to applications and is not required for cross-staff arpeggios.

.. py:class:: XSDComplexTypeArrow(value=None, parent=None, *args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`XSDComplexType`

   The arrow element represents an arrow used for a musical technical indication. It can represent both Unicode and SMuFL arrows. The presence of an arrowhead element indicates that only the arrowhead is displayed, not the arrow stem. The smufl attribute distinguishes different SMuFL glyphs that have an arrow appearance such as arrowBlackUp, guitarStrumUp, or handbellsSwingUp. The specified glyph should match the descriptive representation.

   Bases: :py:obj:`XSDComplexType`

   By default, an assessment application should assess all notes without a cue child element, and not assess any note with a cue child element. The assess type allows this default assessment to be overridden for individual notes. The optional player and time-only attributes restrict the type to apply to a single player or set of times through a repeated section, respectively. If missing, the type applies to all players or all times through the repeated section, respectively. The player attribute references the id attribute of a player element defined within the matching score-part.

   Bases: :py:obj:`XSDComplexType`

   The backup and forward elements are required to coordinate multiple voices in one part, including music on multiple staves. The backup type is generally used to move between voices and staves. Thus the backup element does not include voice or staff elements. Duration values should always be positive, and should not cross measure boundaries or mid-measure changes in the divisions value.

.. py:class:: XSDComplexTypeBeam(value=None, parent=None, *args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`XSDComplexType`

   Beam values include begin, continue, end, forward hook, and backward hook. Up to eight concurrent beams are available to cover up to 1024th notes. Each beam in a note is represented with a separate beam element, starting with the eighth note beam using a number attribute of 1.

   Note that the beam number does not distinguish sets of beams that overlap, as it does for slur and other elements. Beaming groups are distinguished by being in different voices and/or the presence or absence of grace and cue elements.

   Beams that have a begin value can also have a fan attribute to indicate accelerandos and ritardandos using fanned beams. The fan attribute may also be used with a continue value if the fanning direction changes on that note. The value is "none" if not specified.

   The repeater attribute has been deprecated in MusicXML 3.0. Formerly used for tremolos, it needs to be specified with a "yes" value for each beam using it.

   Bases: :py:obj:`XSDComplexType`

   The elision type represents an elision between lyric syllables. The text content specifies the symbol used to display the elision. Common values are a no-break space (Unicode 00A0), an underscore (Unicode 005F), or an undertie (Unicode 203F). If the text content is empty, the smufl attribute is used to specify the symbol to use. Its value is a SMuFL canonical glyph name that starts with lyrics. The SMuFL attribute is ignored if the elision glyph is already specified by the text content. If neither text content nor a smufl attribute are present, the elision glyph is application-specific.

   The harmonic type indicates natural and artificial harmonics. Allowing the type of pitch to be specified, combined with controls for appearance/playback differences, allows both the notation and the sound to be represented. Artificial harmonics can add a notated touching pitch; artificial pinch harmonics will usually not notate a touching pitch. The attributes for the harmonic element refer to the use of the circular harmonic symbol, typically but not always used with natural harmonics.

.. py:class:: XSDComplexTypeLyric(value=None, parent=None, *args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`XSDComplexType`

   The lyric type represents text underlays for lyrics. Two text elements that are not separated by an elision element are part of the same syllable, but may have different text formatting. The MusicXML XSD is more strict than the DTD in enforcing this by disallowing a second syllabic element unless preceded by an elision element. The lyric number indicates multiple lines, though a name can be used as well. Common name examples are verse and chorus.

   Justification is center by default; placement is below by default. Vertical alignment is to the baseline of the text and horizontal alignment matches justification. The print-object attribute can override a note's print-lyric attribute in cases where only some lyrics on a note are printed, as when lyrics for later verses are printed in a block of text rather than with each note. The time-only attribute precisely specifies which lyrics are to be sung which time through a repeated section.

   The notehead type indicates shapes other than the open and closed ovals associated with note durations. 

   The smufl attribute can be used to specify a particular notehead, allowing application interoperability without requiring every SMuFL glyph to have a MusicXML element equivalent. This attribute can be used either with the "other" value, or to refine a specific notehead value such as "cluster". Noteheads in the SMuFL Note name noteheads and Note name noteheads supplement ranges (U+E150–U+E1AF and U+EEE0–U+EEFF) should not use the smufl attribute or the "other" value, but instead use the notehead-text element.

   For the enclosed shapes, the default is to be hollow for half notes and longer, and filled otherwise. The filled attribute can be set to change this if needed.

   If the parentheses attribute is set to yes, the notehead is parenthesized. It is no by default.

   The other-notation type is used to define any notations not yet in the MusicXML format. It handles notations where more specific extension elements such as other-dynamics and other-technical are not appropriate. The smufl attribute can be used to specify a particular notation, allowing application interoperability without requiring every SMuFL glyph to have a MusicXML element equivalent.

.. py:class:: XSDComplexTypeTie(value=None, parent=None, *args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`XSDComplexType`

   The tie element indicates that a tie begins or ends with this note. If the tie element applies only particular times through a repeat, the time-only attribute indicates which times to apply it. The tie element indicates sound; the tied element indicates notation.

.. py:class:: XSDComplexTypeTied(value=None, parent=None, *args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`XSDComplexType`

   The tied element represents the notated tie. The tie element represents the tie sound.

   The number attribute is rarely needed to disambiguate ties, since note pitches will usually suffice. The attribute is implied rather than defaulting to 1 as with most elements. It is available for use in more complex tied notation situations.

   Ties that join two notes of the same pitch together should be represented with a tied element on the first note with type="start" and a tied element on the second note with type="stop".  This can also be done if the two notes being tied are enharmonically equivalent, but have different step values. It is not recommended to use tied elements to join two notes with enharmonically inequivalent pitches.

   Ties that indicate that an instrument should be undamped are specified with a single tied element with type="let-ring".

   Ties that are visually attached to only one note, other than undamped ties, should be specified with two tied elements on the same note, first type="start" then type="stop". This can be used to represent ties into or out of repeated sections or codas.

.. py:class:: XSDComplexTypeTimeModification(value=None, parent=None, *args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`XSDComplexType`

   Time modification indicates tuplets, double-note tremolos, and other durational changes. A time-modification element shows how the cumulative, sounding effect of tuplets and double-note tremolos compare to the written note type represented by the type and dot elements. Nested tuplets and other notations that use more detailed information need both the time-modification and tuplet elements to be represented accurately.

.. py:class:: XSDComplexTypeTremolo(value=None, parent=None, *args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`XSDComplexType`

   The tremolo ornament can be used to indicate single-note, double-note, or unmeasured tremolos. Single-note tremolos use the single type, double-note tremolos use the start and stop types, and unmeasured tremolos use the unmeasured type. The default is "single" for compatibility with Version 1.1. The text of the element indicates the number of tremolo marks and is an integer from 0 to 8. Note that the number of attached beams is not included in this value, but is represented separately using the beam element. The value should be 0 for unmeasured tremolos.

   When using double-note tremolos, the duration of each note in the tremolo should correspond to half of the notated type value. A time-modification element should also be added with an actual-notes value of 2 and a normal-notes value of 1. If used within a tuplet, this 2/1 ratio should be multiplied by the existing tuplet ratio.

   The smufl attribute specifies the glyph to use from the SMuFL Tremolos range for an unmeasured tremolo. It is ignored for other tremolo types. The SMuFL buzzRoll glyph is used by default if the attribute is missing.

   Using repeater beams for indicating tremolos is deprecated as of MusicXML 3.0.

.. py:class:: XSDComplexTypeTuplet(value=None, parent=None, *args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`XSDComplexType`

   A tuplet element is present when a tuplet is to be displayed graphically, in addition to the sound data provided by the time-modification elements. The number attribute is used to distinguish nested tuplets. The bracket attribute is used to indicate the presence of a bracket. If unspecified, the results are implementation-dependent. The line-shape attribute is used to specify whether the bracket is straight or in the older curved or slurred style. It is straight by default.

   Whereas a time-modification element shows how the cumulative, sounding effect of tuplets and double-note tremolos compare to the written note type, the tuplet element describes how this is displayed. The tuplet element also provides more detailed representation information than the time-modification element, and is needed to represent nested tuplets and other complex tuplets accurately.

   The show-number attribute is used to display either the number of actual notes, the number of both actual and normal notes, or neither. It is actual by default. The show-type attribute is used to display either the actual type, both the actual and normal types, or neither. It is none by default.

   Bases: :py:obj:`XSDComplexType`

   The tuplet-portion type provides optional full control over tuplet specifications. It allows the number and note type (including dots) to be set for the actual and normal portions of a single tuplet. If any of these elements are absent, their values are based on the time-modification element.

   Bases: :py:obj:`XSDComplexType`

   The unpitched type represents musical elements that are notated on the staff but lack definite pitch, such as unpitched percussion and speaking voice. If the child elements are not present, the note is placed on the middle line of the staff. This is generally used with a one-line staff. Notes in percussion clef should always use an unpitched element rather than a pitch element.

.. py:class:: XSDComplexTypeWait(value=None, parent=None, *args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`XSDComplexType`

   The wait type specifies a point where the accompaniment should wait for a performer event before continuing. This typically happens at the start of new sections or after a held note or indeterminate music. These waiting points cannot always be inferred reliably from the contents of the displayed score. The optional player and time-only attributes restrict the type to apply to a single player or set of times through a repeated section, respectively.

.. py:class:: XSDComplexTypeCredit(value=None, parent=None, *args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`XSDComplexType`

   The credit type represents the appearance of the title, composer, arranger, lyricist, copyright, dedication, and other text, symbols, and graphics that commonly appear on the first page of a score. The credit-words, credit-symbol, and credit-image elements are similar to the words, symbol, and image elements for directions. However, since the credit is not part of a measure, the default-x and default-y attributes adjust the origin relative to the bottom left-hand corner of the page. The enclosure for credit-words and credit-symbol is none by default.

   By default, a series of credit-words and credit-symbol elements within a single credit element follow one another in sequence visually. Non-positional formatting attributes are carried over from the previous element by default.

   The page attribute for the credit element specifies the page number where the credit should appear. This is an integer value that starts with 1 for the first page. Its value is 1 by default. Since credits occur before the music, these page numbers do not refer to the page numbering specified by the print element's page-number attribute.

   The credit-type element indicates the purpose behind a credit. Multiple types of data may be combined in a single credit, so multiple elements may be used. Standard values include page number, title, subtitle, composer, arranger, lyricist, rights, and part name.

   The defaults type specifies score-wide defaults for scaling; whether or not the file is a concert score; layout; and default values for the music font, word font, lyric font, and lyric language. Except for the concert-score element, if any defaults are missing, the choice of what to use is determined by the application.

   Multiple part-link elements can link a condensed part within a score file to multiple MusicXML parts files. For example, a "Clarinet 1 and 2" part in a score file could link to separate "Clarinet 1" and "Clarinet 2" part files. The instrument-link type distinguish which of the score-instruments within a score-part are in which part file. The instrument-link id attribute refers to a score-instrument id attribute.

.. py:class:: XSDComplexTypePartGroup(value=None, parent=None, *args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`XSDComplexType`

   The part-group element indicates groupings of parts in the score, usually indicated by braces and brackets. Braces that are used for multi-staff parts should be defined in the attributes element for that part. The part-group start element appears before the first score-part in the group. The part-group stop element appears after the last score-part in the group.

   The number attribute is used to distinguish overlapping and nested part-groups, not the sequence of groups. As with parts, groups can have a name and abbreviation. Values for the child elements are ignored at the stop of a group.

   A part-group element is not needed for a single multi-staff part. By default, multi-staff parts include a brace symbol and (if appropriate given the bar-style) common barlines. The symbol formatting for a multi-staff part can be more fully specified using the part-symbol element.

   The part-link type allows MusicXML data for both score and parts to be contained within a single compressed MusicXML file. It links a score-part from a score document to MusicXML documents that contain parts data. In the case of a single compressed MusicXML file, the link href values are paths that are relative to the root folder of the zip file.

   The part-list identifies the different musical parts in this document. Each part has an ID that is used later within the musical data. Since parts may be encoded separately and combined later, identification elements are present at both the score and score-part levels. There must be at least one score-part, combined as desired with part-group elements that indicate braces and brackets. Parts are ordered from top to bottom in a score based on the order in which they appear in the part-list.

.. py:class:: XSDComplexTypeScoreInstrument(value=None, parent=None, *args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`XSDComplexType`

   The score-instrument type represents a single instrument within a score-part. As with the score-part type, each score-instrument has a required ID attribute, a name, and an optional abbreviation.

   A score-instrument type is also required if the score specifies MIDI 1.0 channels, banks, or programs. An initial midi-instrument assignment can also be made here. MusicXML software should be able to automatically assign reasonable channels and instruments without these elements in simple cases, such as where part names match General MIDI instrument names.

   The score-instrument element can also distinguish multiple instruments of the same type that are on the same part, such as Clarinet 1 and Clarinet 2 instruments within a Clarinets 1 and 2 part.

   The score-part type collects part-wide information for each part in a score. Often, each MusicXML part corresponds to a track in a Standard MIDI Format 1 file. In this case, the midi-device element is used to make a MIDI device or port assignment for the given track or specific MIDI instruments. Initial midi-instrument assignments may be made here as well. The score-instrument elements are used when there are multiple instruments per track.
