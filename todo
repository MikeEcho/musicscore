Look at the following features and try to simplify the process. How can a user influence the notation of note types, dots,
beams in a beat or change or extend the default behaviour in such cases and split the unwritable quarter durations.
    * SPLITTALBES
    * is_writable
    * type
    * dot
    * beam

Let's try to understand all main steps of writing a beat with following quarter durations: 1/8 5/8 2/8
(see writing beats)


measure.new_system

measure: break or connect beams manually


XMLNonArpeggiate > type


test to_string method of all Classes (Chord raises an Error, Beat and Voice too?)

articulations with mixed placements (s. Lily.Notations)

profiler

coverage

lint flake8

inconsistency: part.add_measure(): adds a staff, add_staff()

quarter duration only to: 32nd (64th and 128th must be supported too)

check _is_writable
Manually set type and number of dots (for example if is_writable is False and for 64th or 128th)
Manually set tuplets

chord.add_direction : add direction objects to a list (don't use {'above':[], 'below':[]} dictionary like it is now to preserve order of added directions)
